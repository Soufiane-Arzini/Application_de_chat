Client-Server Chat Application using Java Sockets
This project implements a client-server chat application utilizing Java sockets for secure communication between clients and the server. The application supports real-time message exchange, demonstrating the use of TCP sockets for reliable bidirectional communication. Additionally, it incorporates encryption mechanisms like AES for symmetric encryption and RSA for secure key exchange, ensuring data confidentiality during transmission.

Features:
Real-time Messaging: Clients can send and receive messages through a centralized server.
Security: The application uses AES encryption for message security and RSA for secure key distribution.
Server and Client Implementation: The server handles multiple clients, ensuring a smooth communication flow.
Feel free to explore the code and contribute to future developments!
